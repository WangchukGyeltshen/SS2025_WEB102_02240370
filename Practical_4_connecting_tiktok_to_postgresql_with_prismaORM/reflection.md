# Reflection.md

## a) Documentation

In this practical, I connected the TikTok backend application to a PostgreSQL database using **Prisma ORM**. The main concepts I applied included:

- **Database Configuration**: I created a PostgreSQL database and user, and configured the connection using environment variables stored in a `.env` file.
- **Prisma Setup**: I initialized Prisma in the project, defined the schema in `schema.prisma`, and generated a Prisma Client to interact with the database.
- **Migrations**: Used `npx prisma migrate dev` to apply database changes and create migration files for version control.
- **ORM Concepts**: Defined models like `User`, `Video`, `Comment`, etc., which Prisma mapped to PostgreSQL tables with relationships.
- **Authentication**: Implemented user registration and login using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for secure token-based authentication.
- **Database Integration**: Updated all controllers to interact with the PostgreSQL database via Prisma instead of using in-memory data.
- **Seed Script**: Created a `seed.js` file to populate the database with test data (users, videos, comments, likes, and follows) for testing purposes.

## b) Reflection

This practical gave me real-world experience in replacing mock data with a real relational database and using an ORM to simplify data access and management. It was a big step forward from earlier exercises where I worked only with static data or in-memory objects.

### What I Learned
- How to set up and connect to a PostgreSQL database using Prisma ORM.
- Writing database schemas in Prismaâ€™s DSL and managing schema migrations.
- Creating and running seed scripts to populate test data for development.
- Securing API endpoints with JWT authentication and protecting routes using middleware.
- Structuring backend code to be modular and maintainable while working with persistent storage.
- Testing the full flow of user registration, login, and authorized access to protected API routes using Postman.

### Challenges Faced

One challenge I faced was getting the database connection to work. I initially had a typo in the `.env` file which caused the Prisma Client to fail. After reviewing the connection string and confirming the user and database names, I corrected it and Prisma connected successfully.

Another issue was updating all controller logic from mock data to asynchronous database calls. It took time to refactor existing code to use `await` and handle potential exceptions properly. After a few iterations and testing with Postman, everything was functioning correctly.

Overall, this practical helped solidify my understanding of relational databases and how to connect them with Node.js applications using an ORM. I now feel much more confident in managing real data, building secure authentication, and working with backend systems that interact with a production-grade database.
